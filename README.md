# MyReads Project

This application keeps track of books a user is interested in reading. The main components are Library and Search.
Library consists of 3 different Bookshelves (Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read) each with their corresponding Books.
Search lets a user find new Books to add to their Library.
Books can also be moved from one shelf to another or be removed from the user's Library.

Of course, you are free to start this project from scratch if you wish! Just be sure to use [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.
